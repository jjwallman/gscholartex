Parse saved Google Scholar webpage to extract citation data

Use
---
1) Clone the repository
2) Open your Google Scholar profile
3) Click "Show more" at the bottom until the desired number of citations are showing
4) Save the website into the repository (use the default name)
5) Run example.py

Limitations
-----------
The Google Scholar API is a little difficult and blocks repeated requests.
I have not been able to find a way to load a profile with a specific number of citations showing, hence the manual steps.
